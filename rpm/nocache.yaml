Description: |
    The nocache tool tries to minimize the effect an application has on the Linux
    file system cache. This is done by intercepting the open and close system calls
    and calling posix_fadvise with the POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED parameter.
    Because the library remembers which pages (ie., 4K-blocks of the file) were
    already in file system cache when the file was opened, these will not be
    marked as "don't need", because other applications might need that,
    although they are not actively used (think: hot standby).

    Use case: backup processes that should not interfere with the present state of the cache.

    BUT: Read the README on github or under the Help link on why you probably
    don't need this, and how to do what this tool does on a systemd system.
